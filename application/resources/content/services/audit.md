# Architecture and codebase audit

Nobody can add security and reliability to the completed product, we propose to
solve this at the architectural and org. level, introduce secure by design
principle. We can help with code refactoring, removing legacy and vulnerable
dependencies, optimize code maintainability with Clean architecture, DDD, GRASP
and SOLID.

Also we do certification and custom trainings to assess and improve team skils
in computer sciense, cutting-edge technologies, architectural solutions, private
cloud platforms and development process.

## Software audit and architecture assessment:

- Current state of technology stack
- Architecture and technologies review
- Code review and development process audit
- Help with code refactoring, removing legacy and vulnerable dependencies
- Prepare transformation plan proposal
- Propose technology strategy, budget and timeline
- Find bottlenecks and assess gaps in existing architecture
- Define key requirements and vision for the future
- Assist in evaluation of technology and tool selection
- Assist design and implementation of process flows
